# **Test Plan**

**Author: Team 075**

**1 Testing Strategy**

  1. **Overall strategy**

The success of the Job Compare android application depends on the test results defined in the place. Team 075 will be performing manual testing for the functionality of the application. Furthermore, the team will use JUnit for component-level validations. The team will review the scope, the mockups, and use cases and approve the test approach. Clear roles and responsibilities are defined for each team member. Team075 will leverage Microsoft Team task tracking to record bugs found in the application.

**1.2 Test Selection**

For this assignment, we have decided on the functional testing of the application by some manual validations and JUnit for component-level testing.

**1.3 Adequacy Criterion**

All the test cases will be functional, i.e., testing the operational requirements of the Job Compare application. The use cases provide the functionality of the application. The test cases outlined below ensure that the application meets the desired output/responses of the values entered in the forms. The test cases do not cover performance tests, security tests, or load stress as this is a single-user application (as defined in the requirements in D1).

**1.4 Bug Tracking**

For bug tracking, we will be using Microsoft Team – Tasks by Planner. We will open bugs against the tasks created as part of the D1 and D2 assignments. All the bugs will have an owner for resolution.

**1.5 Technology**

Manual testing will be used for most of the test cases—some of the component-level testing by Junit.
